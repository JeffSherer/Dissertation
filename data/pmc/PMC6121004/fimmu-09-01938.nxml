In cultured primary bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) stimulated with HMGB1, the number of cells with macrophage-like morphology was markedly increased in association with an increased expression of CD11b/Mac-1, which were attenuated in cells pre-treated with Zileuton, a 5-LO inhibitor as well as in 5-LO-deficient BMDCs. Of various leukotriene receptor inhibitors examined, which included leukotriene B4 receptors (BLTRs) and cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (cysLTRs), the BLTR1 inhibitor (U75302) exclusively suppressed MMD induction by HMGB1. The importance of BLTR1 in HMGB1-induced MMD was also observed in BMDCs isolated from BLTR1-deficient mice and BMDCs transfected with BLTR1 siRNA. Although leukotriene B4 (LTB4) had minimal direct effects on MMD in control and 5-LO-deficient BMDCs, MMD attenuation by HMGB1 in 5-LO-deficient BMDCs was significantly reversed by exogenous LTB4, but not in BLTR1-deficient BMDCs, suggesting that LTB4/BLTR1-mediated priming of monocytes is a prerequisite of HMGB1-induced MMD. <italic>In vivo</italic>, both macrophage infiltration and intimal hyperplasia in our wire-injured femoral artery were markedly attenuated in BLTR1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type controls, but these effects were reversed in BLTR1-deficient mice transplanted with monocytes from control mice. These results suggest that BLTR1 in monocytes is a pivotal player in MMD with subsequent macrophage infiltration into neointima, leading to vascular remodeling after vascular injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>high mobility group box 1</kwd><kwd>5-lipoxygenase</kwd><kwd>leukotriene B4 receptor</kwd><kwd>monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation</kwd><kwd>vascular restenosis</kwd><kwd>intimal hyperplasia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Research Foundation of Korea<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003725</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">NRF-2016R1A2B2011509</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">NRF-2015R1A5A2009656</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6352"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vascular endoluminal interventional procedures injure vascular walls, and result in the release endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Of the various DAMP proteins, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) has emerged as an important regulator of inflammatory responses resulting from tissue injury (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and been implicated as an active player in vascular inflammation with resultant intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In a previous study, we found HMGB1 enhanced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (MMD) and resultant vascular inflammation in injured vasculature (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and thus, we suggested coordinated relationships exist between local vascular injury and pattern recognition receptor-related signals in the process of vascular inflammation.</p><p>Monocyte recruitment to injured tissues, their subsequent transformation into macrophages, and the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines are major steps in the process of vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These sequential events stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition in neointima, which result in intimal hyperplasia and vascular occlusion (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, several key proteins involved in the leukotriene cascades, such as, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), and leukotriene (LT) receptors are highly expressed in human atherosclerotic plaque (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which suggests their potential involvements in vascular inflammation.</p><p>Previous studies have reported genetic targeting of 5-LO reduced lesion size in atherosclerosis prone mouse strains (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Likewise, in a previous study, we found 5-LO importantly contributed to the development of atherosclerosis by increasing the expressions of adhesion molecules on monocytes, and thus, increasing monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In FLAP-deficient mice, neointima hyperplasia in injured arteries was significantly attenuated by reducing inflammatory cytokine release from FLAP-deficient macrophages (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which suggested 5-LO in macrophages plays a pivotal role in vascular inflammation. However, although 5-LO in inflammatory cells has been proposed to be an important player in the development of vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the importance of 5-LO signaling pathways in monocytes in vascular inflammation with subsequent vascular remodeling in injured vasculatures remains unclear.</p><p>Leukotrienes (LTs) are considered to mediate inflammatory responses in various cardiovascular diseases characterized by vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). LTs exert their actions via four subclasses of receptors, such as, BLT1 and BLT2 (receptors for LTB4), and CysLT1 and CysLT2 (receptors for cysteinyl-leukotrienes) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Previous studies have implicated LT receptor activation in atherogenesis and vascular remodeling after angioplasty (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and studies on the genetic and pharmacological targeting of BLTR1 in atherosclerotic mouse strains further supported the involvement of leukotriene-signaling in vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the precise role of BLTR1 signaling in monocytes in the process of vascular inflammation remains unclear.</p><p>In a previous study, we described the importance of 5-LO in monocytes during vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, our incomplete understanding of how 5-LO signaling pathways in monocytes contribute to vascular inflammation explains the incapability of current treatments to prevent vascular remodeling in the injured vasculatures. Given the importance of HMGB1 and 5-LO signaling in monocytes during vascular inflammation, we investigated the role of leukotriene signaling in monocytes on MMD induced by HMGB1. To further determine the contribution of 5-LO signaling in monocytes in macrophage infiltration into neointima lesions, we also investigated the importance of BLTR1 signaling in monocytes in vascular inflammation and subsequent intimal hyperplasia using BLTR1-deficient mice and BLTR1-deficient mice transplanted with monocytes from WT mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement and animals</title><p>All experiments involving animals conformed with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, 2011 revision), and all animal-related experimental protocols were approved by the Pusan National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the College of Medicine (PNU-2016-1310).

In cultured primary BMDCs, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in monocytes attenuated MMD induced by HMGB1, an endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns. Among various inhibitors for leukotriene receptors, U75302, a BLTR1 inhibitor, exclusively attenuated MMD induced by HMGB1. The importance of BLTR1 signaling during HMGB1-induced MMD was also demonstrated using BLTR1-deficient BMDCs. Thus, BLTR1 signaling in monocytes was suggested as a pivotal player in MMD induced by HMGB1, leading to vascular inflammation after vascular injury.</p><p>MMD is a key event in the process of vascular inflammation, which results in the remodeling of the injured vasculatures (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, an understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that underlie this differentiation is an important aspect of identifying new therapeutic strategies. In our previous study, the importance of 5-LO in monocytes was identified using genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the 5-LO pathway in monocytes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, in accordance with previous report by Yu et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) in which disruption of the LT synthesis/response pathway in myeloid cells restrained several components of response to injury, we showed in a previous <italic>in vivo</italic> study 5-LO in monocytes played a pivotal role in vascular inflammation and resultant restenosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, although the importance of 5-LO in monocytes during MMD with subsequent vascular inflammation was identified, the 5-LO-linked signaling in monocytes mediating MMD need to be identified to develop specific target-based therapeutics, because 5-LO in monocytes exert its action via production of various leukotrienes (LT) including LTB4 and cysteinyl LTs.</p><p>Leukotrienes exert their actions via four subclasses of 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors. BLTR1 and BLTR2 are high and low affinity receptors of LTB4, respectively, whereas CysLT1 and CysLT2 are activated by cysteinyl-LTs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, we stimulated BMDCs in the presence of various inhibitors for LT receptors including LTB4 receptors (BLTR1 or BLTR2) or cysteinyl LT receptors (cysLTR1 or cysLTR2). In our present study, U75302 (a BLTR1 inhibitor) exclusively attenuated MMD induced by HMGB1 among various inhibitors. The importance of BLTR1 in monocytes on HMGB1-induced MMD was also demonstrated using BLTR1-deficient cells. Moreover, HMGB1 increased 5-LO expression in monocytes with subsequent production of LTB4 in the present study, suggesting that HMGB1 might induce MMD via production of 5-LO-mediated production of LTB4.</p><p>To determine the direct functional role of exogenous LTB4 on MMD, BMDCs were stimulated with various concentrations of LTB4 in the absence or presence of HMGB1. We found that LTB4 had minimal effects on MMD in cells from control, 5-LO-deficient and BLTR1-deficient mice. However, MMD suppression by HMGB1 was significantly reversed by exogenous LTB4 in 5-LO-deficient cells, but not in BLTR1-deficient cells, suggesting LTB4/BLTR1 signaling as a pivotal player for HMGB1-induced MMD. Thus, LTB4/BLTR1-mediated priming of monocytes is considered as an essential prerequisite for HMGB1-induced MMD based on the previous report that exogenous LTB4 potentiated the priming effect of cytokines on human monocytes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, further studies are remained to determine the precise roles of these signals in cell priming.</p><p>The molecular processes that initiate inflammation in arterial walls after mechanical injury are not fully understood. Recently, endogenous molecules released during cell death and stress, termed DAMPs, could activate pattern recognition receptors and lead to inflammation, because endoluminal vascular interventional procedures cause stretching of vessel walls and subsequent cell necrosis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Thus, coordinated relationships exist between local vascular injury and pattern recognition receptor-related signals in the process of vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Of the various DAMPs, HMGB1 has emerged as an important regulator of inflammatory responses resulting from tissue injury (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and has been implicated as an active player in vascular inflammation leading to intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Reportedly, HMGB1 is known to have pro-inflammatory cytokine-like activity, promote chemotaxis, and stimulate cellular migration and growth (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Interestingly, in a previous study we found HMGB1 enhanced MMD and caused vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that HMGB1-related signals in monocytes might be considered therapeutic targets for the treatment of vascular inflammation.</p><p>In our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, both macrophage infiltration and intimal hyperplasia in the wire-injured femoral artery were markedly attenuated in BLTR1-deficient mice compared to that in wild-type control mice. Although the importance of BLTR1 in vascular smooth muscle cells in the intimal hyperplasia has been reported previously (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we expected the potential role for BLTR1 in monocytes in vascular inflammation on the basis of our <italic>in vitro</italic> data in which the BLTR1 signaling in monocytes played a pivotal role in MMD induced by HMGB1. To confirm the contribution of BLTR1 in monocytes in macrophage infiltration into neointimal lesion, BMDMs isolated from WT mice were adoptively transferred into BLTR1-deficient mice as previously described (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In our present study, intimal hyperplasia and macrophage infiltration were significantly greater in BLTR1-deficient mice administered WT BMDMs than those in BLTR1-deficient mice administered BLTR1-deficient BMDMs. Based on these results, it was suggested that BLTR1 in monocytes played a pivotal role in MMD induced by HMGB1, and subsequent macrophage infiltration in the injured vasculatures with neointima formation in our murine wire-injured femoral artery model.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SEB and CDK designed and performed experiments, analyzed the experimental data, and wrote the manuscript, and SSB, KK, and WSL contributed to data analysis.
