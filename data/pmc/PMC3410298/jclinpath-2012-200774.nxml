Nevertheless, recent studies appear to cast doubt on this negative view. A randomised phase III trial (ToGA) in advanced GC patients with 3+ HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor type 2) overexpression measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or with <italic>HER2</italic> amplification determined by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) has demonstrated that trastuzumab added to standard chemotherapy leads to a significant improvement in patients' survival compared with chemotherapy alone, setting a new standard of treatment for these patients. The results of this trial have prompted the use of IHC test followed by FISH in IHC2+ cases for HER2 diagnostics. Dual colour silver enhanced <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (dc-SISH) is a new technique which combines the accuracy of the FISH technique and the morphological control of the IHC technique. In opposition to what has been stated by European Medicines Agency based on the ToGA subanalysis, in this paper we have shown how dc-SISH might be a better approach for the selection of HER2+ GC patients who are candidates to be treated with anti-HER2 therapies.</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>GC is one of the most frequent tumours in the world with approximately 989&#x02008;000 new cases and 738&#x02008;000 deaths per year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> In Spain, this tumour is currently the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in both sexes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> GC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage where curative radical gastrectomy is generally unfeasible and, consequently, survival rate for GC at 5&#x02005;years of diagnosis is under 27%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Chemotherapy improves median overall survival (OS) for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GC; however, no chemotherapy combination has been accepted as the gold standard.</p><p>Recently, a randomised phase III Trial in advanced GC patients (ToGA) with 3+ HER2 overexpression measured by IHC or with HER2 amplification determined by FISH has demonstrated that trastuzumab added to standard chemotherapy leads to a significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone, setting a new standard of treatment for these patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
</p><p>The prognostic value of the HER2 protein expression in GC is a controversial topic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5 b6 b7">5&#x02013;7</xref> Although in most studies HER2 overexpression and/or amplification has been considered a poor prognosis factor,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> recent studies appear to cast doubt on this negative view particularly after the results of the ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> It remains to be explained whether the longer survival rate achieved with standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2 overexpression and/or amplification is related to the presence of this molecular alteration by itself, the greater percentage of intestinal type cases among these patients or if it is due to factors as yet unknown.</p><p>In addition, the results of the ToGA study had prompted the use of IHC test followed by FISH in IHC2+ cases for HER2 diagnostics. Despite FISH being considered the gold standard for HER2 gene amplification, a number of barriers such as the need of specialised equipment or the lack of morphological examination control prevent its wider use in the clinical setting. dc-SISH is a new technique which combines the accuracy of the FISH technique and the tissue histopathological features (morphological control) of the IHC technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Our group has demonstrated the concordance between the FISH and dc-SISH techniques for determining HER2 gene amplification in GC samples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of HER2 gene amplification by FISH and dc-SISH techniques and overexpression by IHC in patients with advanced GC, and to evaluate the association of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression with patient's characteristics and survival, particularly in the subgroup of intestinal type cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients' eligibility</title><p>Tumour samples and medical records from patients who had been consecutively evaluated in our institutions for advanced GC treatment between January 2007 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.</p><p>Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically confirmed advanced or/metastatic GC who had measurable and no measurable lesions by CT scan according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours v1.0<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> who had not received previous treatment at the time of diagnosis. Patients had received treatment in line with the institution usual practice and data on tumour response had been assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours criteria and recorded in the patient's medical record. Tumour samples were obtained prior to any chemotherapy or systemic treatment.</p><p>The study was performed after approval by the Local Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practices, and local ethical and legal requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>Clinical data were collected from medical records by a single clinician blinded to HER2 status, using a datasheet specifically developed for this study. Clinicopathological data such as gender, age, histological type according to the Lauren's classification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> number and locations of metastases, previous surgery for GC and chemotherapy treatment received were reviewed.</p><p>Progression free survival (PFS), OS and clinical benefit rate (patients with either long lasting stabilisation of disease or objective partial or total response) were assessed from individual patient's medical records. OS was measured from the date of diagnosis of metastatic disease until the date of death or last follow-up if alive. PFS was defined as the time from date of diagnosis of metastatic disease until first documentation of PD or death for any cause.</p><p>All H&#x00026;E slides and paraffin blocks were centralised in a referral laboratory (Laboratorio de Dianas Terapeuticas). Two of the investigators (CGM, FLR) selected the most appropriate block and performed the interpretation of the different assays in a blinded manner to each other's results. Also, 4&#x02005;&#x003bc;m-thick sections were cut and placed on charged polylysine-coated slides.</p><p>To determine the frequency of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression in the tumour tissue samples the following assay methods were used: IHC, FISH and dc-SISH. The real-time PCR (RT-PCR) technique was used to study discordant cases. HER2+ disease (HER2+) was defined as IHC3+ or FISH+ (FISH ratio &#x02265;2) or dc-SISH+ (dc-SISH ratio &#x02265;2).</p><p>Due to the retrospective nature of this study, none of the obtained results was used to modify the treatment of patients.</p><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The HER2 protein status was determined by IHC using the Pathway anti-HER2/<italic>neu</italic> (4B5) antibody in the fully automated platform BenchMark ULTRA&#x000ae; (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc, Tucson, Arizona, USA).

</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective was to determine the frequency of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression in patients with advanced GC. Comparisons of the frequency of HER2 overexpression or amplification for different groups were performed using the Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney test (for two groups) or the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test (for more than two groups).</p><p>Secondary objectives were to evaluate the association of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression with patient's characteristics and patient survival. For categorical variables, the possible association between the result of the technique used (IHC, FISH, dc-SISH) and the clinicopathological parameters was analysed using the Fisher's exact test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test (to compare one, two or more than two groups, respectively). Survival analyses (OS and PFS) according to HER2+ status were performed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and differences between the patient groups were tested by the log-rank test. OS analyses were also performed according to the presence of intestinal versus no intestinal disease.</p><p>Multivariate survival analyses were determined using a Cox proportional hazards regression model for each of the HER2 variables together with clinical variables recognised as prognostic factors (peritoneal spread, non-intestinal type and presence of hepatic metastases) including risk ratios and 95% CI. A subgroup analysis based on tumour histology was also done. All tests were two sided, and p values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.15.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients' characteristics</title><p>Complete clinicopathological information was obtained from medical records in 148 out of the 166 patients reviewed.

</p><p>On univariate analysis, median OS was significantly longer in HER2+ patients, despite the determination technique used, and this prognostic value was confirmed in the multivariate survival analyses when dc-SISH was used. These findings corroborate phase III ToGA study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> results, wherein the significant improvement in the mean OS observed with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in patients with HER2+ metastatic GC was mainly the result of the survival advantage conferred to patients with high expression of the HER2 protein and/or confirmed HER2 amplification by FISH. Noteworthy, in the three HER2 determination techniques used the mean OS rates in HER2+ patients in our study almost doubled those achieved in HER2 patients.</p><p>For the whole population, HER2-positivity and the intestinal type were found to be factors associated with a more favourable survival in advanced GC patients in the multivariate survival analyses. The same conclusion was reached in a US and European collaborative analysis recently presented by Shah <italic>et al</italic> at the ASCO 2011 meeting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> However, in the subgroup analysis based on tumour histology and HER2 status, only HER2 amplification determined by means of dc-SISH was deemed to be of prognostic value for intestinal type patients.</p><p>In addition, the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis was found to be a negative prognostic factor for OS in the whole group of patients or when analysing only the subgroup of intestinal patients.</p><p>Despite not being a randomised study (which can be considered a potential weakness of our trial) patients were not selected but were included consecutively as soon as they were referred for assessment; this fact diminishes the possible selection bias.</p><p>The three diagnostic techniques used (IHC, FISH and dc-SISH) have demonstrated to be comparable for HER2 status assessment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Only a low percentage of discordant cases were observed between FISH and dc-SISH or between IHC and FISH, which were resolved by quantitative RT-PCR.</p><p>Even if the three techniques were similar for assessing the subgroup of patients with favourable prognosis, only 10% of HER2+ cases were detected by IHC compared with 18%&#x02013;22% of HER2+ cases detected by hybridisation techniques. In addition, there is a minor subjectivity in the interpretation of results with the hybridisation techniques compared with the IHC method, for which three different criteria have been developed in the last 3&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Hybridisation techniques are less time-depending (signal permanency) and easier to be reproduced interlaboratory and intralaboratory, particularly with the bright-field microscopic technique adopted in the dc-SISH method, which have been validated by our group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
</p><p>In view of all these advantages, and in opposition to what has been stated by European Medicines Agency based on the ToGA subanalysis, we consider that the hybridisation techniques in general, and dc-SISH in particular, might be a better approach for the selection of HER2+ GC patients who are candidates to be treated with anti-HER2 therapies.
