used the finetune_task_LORA shell script from the llava repo
- that script needs the train folder from the llava directory of the llava repo (llava med does not have the neceesary files for the fine tune task)
- still need to use the dependencies of the llava med 
- need to edit the builder.py script to not include device map or tensor flow field
- make adjustment from the discussion post

download images

create evlauation answer file using model_vqa

evaluate using chat gpt
change llm and another file
- issues with the script getting stuck
- got it to run without it getting stuck but the open ai api was not repspoding a clear message


writing plan:

1. Abstract, Introduction, Motivation (10%)
Comments:

Abstract lacks a direct description of the technical contribution.
Introduction is detailed but could benefit from emphasizing the novel contribution.
Action Plan:

Abstract Revision:

Clearly state the technical contributions of the project. For example: "This project focuses on augmenting the visual grounding capabilities of SOTA Multimodal Foundation models in the healthcare domain by implementing a fine-tuning algorithm that improves accuracy in medical visual question answering (VQA)."
Introduction Enhancement:

Emphasize the novel contribution by highlighting the specific technical advancements. For example: "The proposed methodologies aim to extend the visual grounding capabilities of LLava-Med, providing significant improvements in medical VQA tasks which are critical for developing personal assistants for medical practitioners."
2. Literature Review (40%)
Comments:

The literature review is comprehensive and well-structured but heavily focuses on reviewing existing work.
Action Plan:

Incorporate Technical Contribution:
Integrate discussions on how your work builds upon and differs from the surveyed literature. Highlight the gaps identified in the current SOTA models and datasets that your work addresses.
For example, add a section titled "Technical Contributions and Innovations" that discusses the advancements your methodology introduces compared to existing works.
3. Requirements and/or Proposed Methodology (30%)
Comments:

The methodology section should stress the importance of visual grounding capabilities.
Dataset selection process is not detailed.
Action Plan:

Reinforce Importance:
At the beginning of the methodology section, clearly state why improving visual grounding is crucial. For example: "Enhancing visual grounding capabilities is essential for accurate interpretation of medical images, leading to better diagnostic support."
Dataset Selection Explanation:
Explicitly justify the selection of SLAKE over other datasets. For example: "SLAKE was selected due to its detailed visual annotations in the form of bounding boxes and masks, which are critical for training and evaluating the proposed visual grounding enhancements."
4. Project Plan (20%)
Comments:

The high-level steps are realistic but lack detailed breakdown in the Gantt chart.
Action Plan:

Detailed Breakdown:
Expand the Gantt chart to include sub-tasks under each high-level task. For example, under "Implementation of Method 1," break it down into "Data Preprocessing," "Algorithm Development," "Initial Testing," etc.
Ensure each phase of the project has clear, specific steps and estimated timelines to demonstrate thorough planning.
5. Academic Misconduct and References (0%)
Comments:

Inconsistent reference style.
Action Plan:

Reference Consistency:
Review all references and ensure consistency in formatting. Use the specified citation commands (\citep and \cite) correctly throughout the document.
For example, ensure that citations are uniform: "(Author, Year)" or "Author (Year)" depending on the context.
